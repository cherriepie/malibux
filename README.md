# malibux

This is a small tool for performing a checklist task. I made this for the company I work at as a small side project so we can do the weekly server backup checks through a web interface at ease to replace old method of manually check off a spreadsheet. 

* Ruby version
ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-darwin15]

* System dependencies
One special thing is that this uses Bootstrap 4, which is still in Alpha version (Today is Feb 9th 2016). I absolutely love bootstrap 4 and just wanted to try it out as soon as I can. Older dependencies that work with bootstrap 3 may not with with the newer version. For all other dependencies, please refer to the Gemfile. 

* Database 
MySQL 2
